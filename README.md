# Optimized Matrix Multiplication and Inversion

This project focuses on optimized matrix multiplication and inversion, with an emphasis on rectangular matrices as a mandatory requirement for multiplication.

## Configuration

### MinGW-w64 Setup

Before diving into the project, ensure that you have MinGW-w64 installed. Follow these steps to configure it:

1. **Download MinGW-w64:**
   - Visit the [MinGW-w64 website](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) and download the installer suitable for your system.

2. **Install MinGW-w64:**
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
   - Make sure to add the MinGW-w64 bin directory to your system's PATH variable.

### Microsoft MPI Setup

For parallel computing, Microsoft MPI is required. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Download Microsoft MPI:**
   - Visit the [Microsoft MPI download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467) and download the installer.

2. **Install Microsoft MPI:**
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Configuration

To work with the project in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. **Install VS Code:**
   - Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Extensions:**
   - Install the necessary extensions for C/C++ development.

3. **Configure Microsoft MPI in VS Code:**
   - Set the MPI executable path in your VS Code configuration.

Now, you are ready to work with the project in VS Code with MinGW-w64 and Microsoft MPI properly configured.
